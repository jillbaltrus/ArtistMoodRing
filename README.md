Welcome to Artist Mood Ring! This interactive UI project lets users search their favorite Spotify artists, makes calls to the Spotify API to retrive relevant data, and displays statistics about the artist's music's features.

I'm not deploying this app, it's just for local use as I built this project as a fun learning experience. To run it, just navigate to the root and run "node server", then navigate to localhost:8000. :)
